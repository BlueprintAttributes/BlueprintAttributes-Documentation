## Modifier Magnitude Calculation

### Requirements

Blueprint parent class needs to be `UGameplayModMagnitudeCalculation`.

Override the functions `CalculateBaseMagnitude`, the equivalent of the `CalculateBaseMagnitude_Implementation` when done in C++.

Make sure to edit the `Relevant Attributes to Capture` in Class Defaults, with all the Attributes your calculation will need.

### Calculation

Start implementing your calculation.

The built-in `UGameplayModMagnitudeCalculation` from the Engine already has a lot of BP exposed helpers. The Blueprint Attributes plugin doesn't need to add more (I'd just have to ensure calculation on BP defined Attributes are still working).

This includes:

- GetCapturedAttributeMagnitude()
  - For this to work correctly, the Attribute needs to be added to the Relevant Attributes to Capture array.
- GetSetByCallerMagnitudeByName()
- GetSourceAggregatedTags()
- GetSourceActorTags()
- GetSourceSpecTags()
- GetTargetAggregatedTags()
- GetTargetActorTags()
- GetTargetSpecTags()

#### Warning for engine prior to 5.3

<Callout type="default">
For engine prior to 5.3, you'll need to rely on a workaround for the issue of const methods. This is fixed in 5.3 and not required anymore.

By wiring in a pure const method that returns a reference to self for any BP exposed methods of MMC (like GetCapturedAttributeMagnitude)

## Example

`SourceTags`, `TargetTags`, `CapturedWeight`, `CapturedFatigue`, `FatigueState`, `Result` are all local variables.
