## Description

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BlueprintAttributes/GBA_ContentExamples)

`GBA_` is a prefix for Gameplay Blueprint Attributes, and used as a naming convention to prefix BP AttributeSets asset names across the project.

The project is a BP only project. You can clone it locally with:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/BlueprintAttributes/GBA_ContentExamples.git
```

## Releases

Latest packaged build (game build with executable) can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/BlueprintAttributes/GBA_ContentExamples/releases).

- [GBA_ContentExamples_Development_Windows.zip](https://github.com/BlueprintAttributes/GBA_ContentExamples/releases/latest/download/GBA_ContentExamples_Development_Windows.zip) ~420 MB

## Engine compatibility

Developed on 5.1 - Should be compatible with Unreal 5.1 versions and higher (you can tweak .uproject `EngineAssociation` field to match your launcher installed engine)

## Maps

In `/Game/Maps`

- `01_BlueprintAttributes_Welcome` - Default entry level map
- `02_Builtin_Clamping` - Built-in clamping example
- `03_MMC` - Modifier Magnitude Calculation example - Fatigue / Weight attributes with MoveSpeed / JumpHeight derived attributes (Warning: MoveSpeed specifically is not properly implemented for multiplayer, proper MoveSpeed replication on CMC goes a bit beyond the scope of this demo project)
- `04_ExecClasses` - Gameplay Effect Execution Class example - Damage output calculation based on AttackPower and Armor mitigation.
- `05_SaveGame` - Save Game example - Gold attribute acting as a currency that gets increased when a box is destroyed. Ctrl+S to save the value, Ctrl+L to load it back.

In a packaged build, you can navigate to a given map using the console command `open Map_Name`, for instance `open 05_SaveGame`.
