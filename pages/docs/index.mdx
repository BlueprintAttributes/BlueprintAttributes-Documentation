# Introduction

The "Gameplay Blueprint Attributes" plugin, also known as "Blueprint Attributes" or GBA for short, is a valuable extension to the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) plugin. It addresses a fundamental limitation of the Unreal Engine, making UAttributeSet fully blueprintable. This enhancement allows for a seamless workflow entirely within the Unreal Engine Editor and Blueprints, simplifying the process of working with Attribute Sets and Gameplay Attributes.

## The Problem

Without the Blueprint Attributes plugin, Unreal Engine requires that Attributes and Attribute Sets must be created exclusively in native code, rendering Blueprint creation impossible. This limitation can be restrictive for Game Designers and Blueprint Developers, hindering their ability to iterate swiftly on Attribute design.

## Solution

This plugin seek to enhance the overall experience of creating and managing Attributes and Attribute Sets.

Blueprint Attributes is designed as a powerful solution to the inherent limitations of Unreal Engine, specifically when it comes to the creation and management of Attributes and Attribute Sets. We recognize that Unreal Engine's default behavior mandates the creation of these vital components exclusively in native code, preventing Game Designers and Blueprint Developers from fully harnessing the potential of Blueprints during game development with GAS.

**Empowering Blueprint Development**: Blueprint Attributes steps in to empower Blueprint Developers and Game Designers by providing a robust and user-friendly framework for managing Attributes. This means that you no longer need to rely solely on C++ coding to define and manipulate Attributes and Attribute Sets. With Blueprint Attributes, you can seamlessly integrate Attributes into your Blueprint-based workflows, eliminating the need for complex and time-consuming native code implementations.

**Fostering Rapid Iteration**: One of the core objectives of Blueprint Attributes is to foster rapid iteration and experimentation during the game development process. By allowing you to work directly within the Unreal Engine Editor and Blueprints, Blueprint Attributes streamlines your workflow and minimizes the obstacles that traditionally slow down the iteration cycle. You can now make real-time changes to Attributes and Attribute Sets, test them, and iterate as needed without the impediments of native code development.

**Enhancing Collaboration**: Blueprint Attributes not only empowers individual developers but also enhances collaboration within development teams. Game Designers can work closely with Blueprint Developers to fine-tune Attributes, leveraging the intuitive visual scripting capabilities of Blueprints. This fosters better communication and a more iterative and collaborative approach to game design.

**Preserving Compatibility**: While Blueprint Attributes introduces a Blueprint-centric approach to Attribute management, it also maintains compatibility with the existing Gameplay Abilities ecosystem and workflow. This ensures that your project remains aligned with Unreal Engine's best practices while benefiting from the advantages of Blueprint-based Attribute creation.

The plugin serves as a bridge between the intuitive visual scripting capabilities of Blueprints and the robust performance of native code. This allows for a seamless transition from prototyping in Blueprints to the optimized efficiency of C++. The Attribute Wizard, a key feature of Blueprint Attributes, streamlines this transition process, providing a clear path to convert Blueprint-defined Attributes into efficient C++ classes.

In summary, Blueprint Attributes is your solution to breaking free from the constraints of native code when working with Attributes and Attribute Sets in Unreal Engine. By offering a user-friendly and versatile approach to Attribute management, it empowers developers, accelerates iteration cycles, encourages collaboration, and seamlessly integrates with existing workflows. With Blueprint Attributes, you're not just overcoming a limitation; you're unlocking the full potential of Unreal Engine's Blueprint system for your game development journey.

## Plugin Features

Blueprint Attributes comes equipped with an extensive set of features to enrich the developer experience and maintain compatibility with the existing Gameplay Abilities ecosystem and workflow. These features include:

1. **Runtime Module**: A runtime module provides a base UAttributeSet class for inheritance.

2. **Custom UBlueprint and FBlueprintEditor**: Custom classes that facilitate Blueprint-based Attribute management.

3. **Editor Modules**: Additional modules for streamlined editor integration.

4. **Details Customizations**: A wide array of classes and Slate widgets to fine-tune attribute details within the Unreal Editor.

5. **Attribute Wizard**: (Note: this is totally optional) A powerful tool designed to assist in transitioning from Attributes defined in Blueprints to C++ classes. It generates the appropriate C++ class based on the AttributeSet defined in Blueprints and the Attributes it contains. This allows developers to either inherit from the generated class or migrate entirely to native implementations.

By providing these features, Blueprint Attributes aims to simplify the workflow and maximize flexibility when working with Attributes in Unreal Engine.

## Key Features of Blueprint Attributes Plugin

**Key Features of Blueprint Attributes Plugin**

1. **Quicker Iterations**
    - Empower Game Designers and Blueprint Developers to rapidly iterate on Attribute design.

2. **Define Attributes in Blueprint**
    - Create Attribute property variables in the Blueprint Editor for immediate use in Gameplay Effects, K2 Nodes (e.g., GetFloatAttribute()), and other locations where a Gameplay Attribute picker is applicable.

3. **Built-in Clamping**
    - Support for clamping via Data Table initialization.
    - Handling of "Min Value" and "Max Value" columns.
    - Customizable clamping using a special Gameplay Clamped Attribute Data property (a child of FGameplayAttributeData) with float or Attribute-based clamping.

4. **Customized Blueprint Editor**
    - Blueprint Editor with Data Validation.
    - Toolbar with quick-access buttons for:
        - Adding Gameplay Attribute properties.
        - Creation of Data Tables.
        - Porting BP Attribute Sets to standard C++ Attribute Sets.
    - Details Customizations to expose Attribute BaseValue to Blueprint and set it directly from the Details panel.

5. **Interactions with Gameplay Effects**
    - Attribute Sets can override several functions to control how an Attribute responds when a Gameplay Effect attempts to modify it.
    - Most of this API is exposed to Blueprints (e.g., PostGameplayEffectExecute, Pre/PostAttributeChange).

6. **Replication**
    - Replication support for Gameplay Attributes defined in Blueprints, suitable for multiplayer projects.
    - Handling of LifetimeReplicatedProps.
    - Integration of rep notifies to manage predictively modified attributes by clients (equivalent to the C++ GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_REPNOTIFY macro).

7. **Integration with K2 Nodes**
    - K2 Nodes (Blueprint nodes) that use FGameplayAttribute parameters now display a list of Attributes defined in Blueprints in the combo box, similar to Gameplay Attribute properties in Gameplay Effects.

8. **Attribute Wizard for Blueprint to C++ Transition**
    - A wizard and Scaffold module facilitate the transition from Blueprint-defined Attributes to C++.
    - Generates proper C++ header and source files (with preview!) based on defined Gameplay Attributes in the BP Attribute Set.

9. **Referencer Handlers**
    - Detects Attribute renaming in the Blueprint Editor.
    - Offers to replace previous references to the renamed Attribute in Gameplay Effects.
    - Displays a list of modified properties and Blueprint nodes (K2Nodes) in the message log with clickable links for easy navigation to the referencers.

These features collectively enhance your workflow, simplify Attribute management, and provide powerful tools for Blueprint-based development within Unreal Engine.
