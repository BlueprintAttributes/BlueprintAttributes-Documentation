    - Few tweaks in class / method descriptions
    - GetAttributeValue now returns a bool indicating if the Attribute was found (and now using UAbilitySystemBlueprint internally)

        - TODO: Might split the class in two
    - Removed old docs folder
    - New `Documentation/` folder with website
        - Most docs page done, remains TODO:
