# Project Setup

The few steps explained here are the minimum requirements to get started with this plugin.

## Enabling the plugin

Make sure to enable the plugin in the Plugins Window.

<Zoom>
![T_Project_Setup_01](./project-setup/T_Project_Setup_01.png)
*Note: The version has a `+5.3` suffix depending on the engine version.*
</Zoom>

Doing so will also enable "Gameplay Abilities" plugin as well (plugin dependency).

<Zoom>
![T_Project_Setup_02](./project-setup/T_Project_Setup_02.png)
</Zoom>

Once done, you can restart the project.
