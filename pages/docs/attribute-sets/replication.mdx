# Replication

For multiplayer projects, you can replicate your Gameplay Attribute defined in Blueprints similar to how you would replicate any other property.

## GetLifetimeReplicatedProps

`GetLifetimeReplicatedProps()` is implemented in `UGBAAttributeSetBlueprintBase (Attribute Set Blueprint Base)`, the UAttributeSet runtime class Blueprint AttributeSet are inheriting from.

It's using the same pattern as Actor Replication or Actor Components, which is going through `UBlueprintGeneratedClass::GetLifetimeBlueprintReplicationList()` to collects all FProperties (Blueprint variables) that are marked for replication.

## Rep Notififies

Using rep notifies, you can handle attributes that will be predictively modified by clients. In Blueprints, that means using `RepNotify` for the replication option and calling `HandleRepNotifyForGameplayAttribute()` within the corresponding RepNotify function implementation.

*Make sure you're using RepNotify for the Replication option*
