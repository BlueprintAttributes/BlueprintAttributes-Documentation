There is an Editor Subsystem defined by Blueprint Attributes plugin whose role is to take care of Attribute properties renames in Blueprints. This system is called internally "Referencer Handlers".

- Detects Attribute renaming in the Blueprint Editor.
- Replace previous references to the renamed Attribute in Gameplay Effects.
- Displays a list of modified properties and Blueprint nodes (K2Nodes) in the message log with clickable links for easy navigation to the referencers.

{/* Note: Since 5.3, Attributes are Asset Registry searchable, meaning Reference Viewer can be used to see their referencers (like Gameplay Tags). */}
