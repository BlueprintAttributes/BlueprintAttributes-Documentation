## C++ Scaffold - In case of clamped attribute, no clamp definitions are generated.

As per Astaror feedback on discord

***

I believe the issue is if you define soem clamping rules / definitions in Blueprint and details panel, the scaffolded C++ class will eventually generate the class and struct definition, but without setting up the inner properties to reflect what was configured in details panel.
