## Fix clamping on initialization

[Runtime: Fix clamping on initialization](https://github.com/BlueprintAttributes/BlueprintAttributes/commit/9ca34f68a6a5d56439c2fca0b3834153f9edb024)

Ensures clamping logic for metadata datables and clamped properties is run (only if InitFromMetaDataTable() is eventually called).

Although this won't run if InitStats (and consequently InitFromMetaDataTable) is not used, or if InitStats() / DefaultStartingData is used with a nullptr DataTable, or granting / creation of AttributeSets is done without calling InitFromMetaDataTable (Lyra for instance).

Tweaked the unit tests to ensure both metadata datable and clamped properties are clamped on initialization.

Fixes [#68](https://github.com/BlueprintAttributes/BlueprintAttributes/issues/68)

***

Also fixed few bugs when Attribute are defined in native (after wizard conversion for instance) and used in a child Blueprint to tweak the attributes in the details panel (Base value, and clamping values for Clamped properties)

[Editor: Fix edition of Base Values for native attributes in child BPs](https://github.com/BlueprintAttributes/BlueprintAttributes/commit/870c8081f8437e7a52159e0ee38ef6e916dfaeee)

Tweaked the details customization for Attribute properties to handle the case of attributes defined in native, but whose values are tweaked in a child Blueprint.
