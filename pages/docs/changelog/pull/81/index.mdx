## WIP work and experiment on SaveGame support

[Runtime: Fixing an issue with clamping](https://github.com/BlueprintAttributes/BlueprintAttributes/pull/81/commits/f3a555f1f1c7946eefb9e7cbbdf80c5f7953bef2)
[f3a555f](https://github.com/BlueprintAttributes/BlueprintAttributes/pull/81/commits/f3a555f1f1c7946eefb9e7cbbdf80c5f7953bef2)
A case was happening of

* InitDataTable was called with a Datatable and BaseValue of 1000, with 0 for Min and Max value
* One property was clamped via FGBAClampDefinition and Property at 100 max
* Then datatable logic kicks in and sets the BaseValue to the value defined in the DT, overriding previously clamped value (from property)
* we would expect here the value to remain at 100

This time using a USaveGame object created with the standard CreateSaveGameFromSlot, LoadGameFromSlot, etc.

SaveGame has a BinaryData array of bytes (TArray<uint8>) . Serialize called with an Archive baked by this array of bytes on Actor and its ASC.

ASC in the test setup implements Serialize with:

```cpp
	Super::Serialize(Ar);

	if (!Ar.IsSaveGame())
	{
		return;
	}

	// SerializeAttributeSets(Ar);

	const TArray<UAttributeSet*>& AttributeSets = GetSpawnedAttributes();
	for (UAttributeSet* AttributeSet : AttributeSets)
	{
		if (!AttributeSet)
		{
			continue;
		}

		AttributeSet->Serialize(Ar);
	}
```
