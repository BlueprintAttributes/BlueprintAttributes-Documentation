## Prevent crash upon using AttributeData in an Owner class that is not an UAttributeSet (In a struct, for instance)

Prevent crash upon using AttributeData in an Owner class different than UGBAAttributeSetBlueprintBase

Bare minimum code to prevent crash. Have to further work on this to better feedback user and raise a compilation warning or editor notification about incorrect use of the type.

Shouldn't use the GameplayAttributeData type, as opposed to GameplayAttribute type in a struct. This PR prevents a crash from happening if used that way.
