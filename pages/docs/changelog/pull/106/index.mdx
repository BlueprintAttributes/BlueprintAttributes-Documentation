## Add REPLICATED_BASE_CLASS to AttributeSet base class, preventing crash from happening on projects with push model enabled.

Prevents assertion check from happening on push model enabled projects.

This shouldn't have any impact on non push model enabled project, as `WITH_PUSH_MODEL` will evaluate to false resulting in a noop.

Checking build against 5.2 and 5.3
