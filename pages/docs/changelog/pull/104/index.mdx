## Fixed Base / Current attribute values change propagation to child classes and better support for reset to default value

My deepest thanks to benw on Discord for the bug report / feedback, and for teaching me a new trick that allowed me to remove a lot of code in details customization, while fixing the issue with inherited BPs and reset to default values.

* Added `bDisplayCurrentValue` in project settings, when set to true will make `CurrentValue` property of Gameplay Attributes visible in details panel (but not editable)
* When BaseValue is edited in details panel, CurrentValue is kept in sync and set to the same value as BaseValue
