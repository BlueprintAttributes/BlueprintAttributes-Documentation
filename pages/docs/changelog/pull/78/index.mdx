## Initial set of BP helpers for Exec Calculations support in Blueprints

TODO:

* Unit / Functional tests
* Further expose Exec class helpers
* Documentation

In the long run:

* [x] Rework Exec class BP capture attributes to be based on the relevant attribute to capture, like it's done in the Gameplay Effect details customization. Do the same thing but on the K2 Pin.
