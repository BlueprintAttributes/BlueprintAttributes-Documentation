## fix: handle attribute renames / removed in 5.5

**fix: handle attribute renames in 5.5**

Changed 2 things:

* Removed usage of `FGameplayAttribute::StaticStruct()->ExportText()` in favor of `Property->GetPathName()` which already has the AttributeName and Package PathName information
* Removed check on `!Attribute.IsValid()` post compile when we try to update the previous references to old name. In 5.5, this returns true even though this is not the case anymore.

On 5.4, Attribute.IsValid() used to return invalid as expected

On 5.5, the `TFieldPath<FProperty> Attribute` is considered valid, which is likely why the rename doesn't happen
and why the bits in `FGameplayAttribute::PostSerialize` to mark the attribute as searchable is executed (and can result
in a crash when for instance compiling / saving a GE, when OwnerVariant is accessed)

The issue still persists when an attribute variable is removed and needs to be handled (this gets addressed in this PR). 5.4 was more resilient to that, and having a None attribute no longer existing attribute was not crashing the editor.

***

**refactor: introduce IGBAAttributeGlobalHandler**

Interface for custom referencer handler not tied to specific references.

Gets lifecycle methods invoked once per event, while referencer handler tied to a given UObject CDO gets invoked once per referencer (assets having a dependency on AttributeSet)

***

**refactor: add support for OnVariableRemoved**

* Handle attribute removal in 5.5
* Broadcast FGBADelegates::OnVariableRemoved for GBAEditorSubsystem and referencer handlers.
